> **REQUIRES ACTION** :
> <br>
> **Updating from a previous version requires several changes** to the `pxconfig.lua` and `nginx.conf`.
> See `examples/Multiple Applications` files for reference.

1. In your `nginx.conf` file, replace `init_worker_by_lua_file` with `init_worker_by_lua_block { require ("px.utils.pxtimer").application() }`

2. In each of the location blocks in your app (each route protected with the module), replace `access_by_lua_file` (in each block of location) with `access_by_lua_block { require("px.pxnginx").application() }`

3. Compare your local `pxconfig.lua` file, with the config file located at `lib/px/pxconfig.lua`, adding in the whitelist filters to the configuration file.
